This a model from the article:  
** Bifurcation and resonance in a model for bursting nerve cells. **

**Abstract:**   
In this paper we consider a model for the phenomenon of bursting in nerve
cells. Experimental evidence indicates that this phenomenon is due to the
interaction of multiple conductances with very different kinetics, and the
model incorporates this evidence. As a parameter is varied the model undergoes
a transition between two oscillatory waveforms; a corresponding transition is
observed experimentally. After establishing the periodicity of the subcritical
oscillatory solution, the nature of the transition is studied. It is found to
be a resonance bifurcation, with the solution branching at the critical point
to another periodic solution of the same period. Using this result a
comparison is made between the model and experimental observations. The model
is found to predict and allow an interpretation of these observations.
